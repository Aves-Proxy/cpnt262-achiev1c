## Attributions
Heavily-referenced freecodecamp's [Chart.js tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-bar-and-line-charts-using-chartjs-in-angular/) to build the line chart. Further utilized chart.js documentation on [Line Chart]](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html) and [Elements](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/elements.html#line-configuration) to figure out the workings of the plugin further.

Data for global temperature was retrieved from [NASA's Global Climate Change website](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/).

## Code Journal
Charts.js looks really intimidating but it makes more sense after reading a tutorial and documentation. Almost certain I've hardly scratched the surface of this tool, though - I definitely need to keep documentation open to work with it at all. Nested arrays and objects are very painful. I'm glad I learned to always always always add a comma after *every* key-value pair even if you don't *need* one for the final pair.
